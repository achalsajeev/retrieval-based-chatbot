        "response": "A large part of the success of Mutual Funds is also the advantages they offer in terms of diversification, professional management and liquidity. Power of Compounding: The longer the period of your investment, the more wealth you can accumulate because of the power of compounding. That\ufffd\u06eas why it makes sense to start investing early. Quite simply, the incremental returns that you earn on your principal, plus accrued gains, is compounded. Rupee Cost Averaging: Most investors want to buy stocks when the prices are low and sell them when the prices are high. But timing the market is time consuming and risky. A more successful investment strategy is to adopt a method called Rupee Cost Averaging. By investing in an SIP you end up buying more units when the price is low and less when the price is high. To set up an SIP, walk in to your nearest HDFC Bank branch or invest through an Investment Services Account. View more"

A monthly SIP helps in averaging out the cost of purchase and benefit from the power of compounding. It also helps in creating wealth over a longer time period. The current investment scenario is still dominated by negative sentiment. This creates volatility in the markets due to confused minds of the investors. Such volatility makes it difficult to capture the market movements and most people end up losing money with the intention of timing the markets.
