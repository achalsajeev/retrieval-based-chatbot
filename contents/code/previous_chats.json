    "message": "Should I buy a plan in my Child\u06eas name or in my own name",
    "response": "When purchasing a Life Insurance plan, it is important to remember that its main purpose is to replace an income that is lost in case of the unfortunate demise of the chief bread winner of the family (Life Assured). A child rarely has an income and therefore has no reason to be insured. If the Insurance Plan is taken in name of the child, the plan gets derailed in case of the unfortunate demise of the parent. Thus, the very objective of any Children\u06eas Plan is undermined if the plan is acquired in the child\u06eas name. Therefore, as far as possible, make sure that you, as a parent, are the Life Assured and the nominee or the beneficiary is your child."

Power of Compounding: The longer the period of your investment, the more wealth you can accumulate because of the power of compounding. That\u06eas why it makes sense to start investing early. Quite simply, the incremental returns that you earn on your principal, plus accrued gains, is compounded. Rupee Cost Averaging: Most investors want to buy stocks when the prices are low and sell them when the prices are high. But timing the market is time consuming and risky. A more successful investment strategy is to adopt a method called Rupee Cost Averaging. By investing in an SIP you end up buying more units when the price is low and less when the price is high. To set up an SIP, walk in to your nearest HDFC Bank branch or invest through an Investment Services Account. View more"

    "response": "The current scenario in the equity market is dominated by negative sentiment, which has led to fundamentals being ignored. This scenario has created volatility in the markets and uncertainty of future outlook. The prudent way to invest in this scenario is to benefit from the volatility and this can be done by investing through SIP\u06eas. A monthly SIP helps in averaging out the cost of purchase and benefit from the power of compounding. It also helps in creating wealth over a longer time period. The current investment scenario is still dominated by negative sentiment. This creates volatility in the markets due to confused minds of the investors. Such volatility makes it difficult to capture the market movements and most people end up losing money with the intention of timing the markets. Also investing a lump sum in one shot might lead you to miss out on market opportunities. The tool to beat such a scenario is investing through a Systematic Investment Plan."
